## Introduction
- **What is an EDA?**
  
EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It's the process where we explore and analyze a dataset to understand its main characteristics and patterns. In simple terms, EDA helps us to dig into the data and find interesting information about it. We look at different aspects of the data, such as its size, and distribution. We also identify any missing or unusual values. By visualizing the data using graphs or charts, we can spot trends or relationships between variables. Overall, EDA helps us get a better understanding of the data before diving into more complex analysis or making decisions based on the information it provides.

- **What is the dataset about?**
  
The "Hospice - General Information" dataset obtained from CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) provides a comprehensive overview of hospice providers. It encompasses crucial details including addresses, phone numbers, and ownership information. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for gaining insights into the characteristics of various hospice facilities. By analyzing this data, researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals can better understand the distribution, ownership patterns, and other key aspects of hospice care provision. The dataset offers a foundation for conducting research, improving service delivery, and making informed decisions in the field of end-of-life care.
